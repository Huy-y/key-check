This partial leg bone has been sharpened into a bone point. There is clear evidence of sharp stone tools being used to refine the bone, which were also found at the site. The fossil has no carnivore tooth marks on it and was found in a shelter on a steep escarpment unsuitable for climbing by this kind of marsupial herbivore. Only humans have the capability and dexterity to make and use these kinds of tools. This leg bone tool, therefore, was made by humans.

Stephen Brookfield (1995), in his analysis of why critical reflection is important to teaching, suggests that \"an uncritical stance towards our practice sets us up for a lifetime of frustration\" (para 2). He suggests this is because teachers can have a different view of their classrooms to what is actually going on: they are unaware. This contradiction fascinates me.<br>C. What we had learnt in our education theory courses didn't quite match up to real-life experience. Having my supervisor give me notes at the end really helped me in evaluating my teaching and planning the next lesson. This, coupled with my own observations of my students allowed me to more closely align what Brookfield would call the \"meaning and significance\" (para 2) I intended for the lesson to what the students took from it.<br>"
